# SQLite-Java-Tekken-Training-Spreadsheet
An application created to solve an issue within my companyâ€™s gaming community. I created an application where talented and experienced Tekken 7 players in the Charlotte area could input their GamerTag/Character into the User Interface and it would store their information into a database on the backend. This created table on the backend would be used to connect new players to the corresponding experienced player who uses the character they like most. This project uses the JDBC library as well as the DriverManager class to establish a connection to the SQLite database; then uses user input combined with Prepared Statements to store and query the table.
